I added two equivalence partitions: one for valid input and another for invalid input.

In the testEquivalencePartitions method, we first test the valid input equivalence partition
by setting valid values for the firstName, job,  sending a POST request to the /users
endpoint.

We then use Assert.assertEquals() method to verify that the response status code is 201,
indicating that the request was successful.

Next, we test the invalid input equivalence partition by setting empty
values for the firstName, job, fields and sending a POST request to the /users endpoint.

We then use Assert.assertEquals() method to verify that the response status code is 400,
indicating that the request was unsuccessful due to invalid input.
